        "description": "Small Royal Doulton jug - creamer or whiskey water jug.\nThe design is pattern no. x2892 made from 1881 - A huntsman with his hunting horn and dogs gallops round the bottom of the jug, towards a windmill, in pursuit of a stag. At the top two men sit in the tavern, one with a clay pipe the other, at the other side of the jug, sitting with a jug of ale. All scenes from rural life of the Victorian period. \nThe mark , as photographed, shows that the jug was made between 1902 and 1922 - This mark was in general use at Burslem between 1902 and 1922. It was introduced in the latter part of 1901 to mark the grant of the Royal Warrant by King Edward VII together with the specific right to use the word ROYAL to designate Doulton products.\nA little bit of the history of Doulton prior to that:\n By 1877 Henry Doulton had established the name of the Doulton Lambeth art wares and set up factories making sanitary, industrial and architectural products in Rowley Regis, St. Helens and Smethwick. He decided to accept an invitation to invest money in Pinder, Bourne & Co., Burslem, a medium-quality earthenware factory. Within ten years he had enlarged the factory three times, built a china works, taken on the largest and most gifted group of artists in the Potteries, and developed for Doulton a reputation for craftsmanship and artistry still identified with Royal Doulton today.\nJug diam. at widest: 3 7/8 ins.\nLength: 4 1/2 ins. across spout and handle\nHt.: 5 7/8 ins.",

Usually I find I am attracted to an item because it is beautiful or beautifully made, and always because it has a story to tell – its own history perhaps, or the story of the people who have owned it, or the person who designed or made it. It may epitomise an era, or just evoke personal memories of another time. My home is filled with fascinating things that I have inherited, collected on my travels, or been given – each with its story to tell – and ‘Gifta May’ is an extension of that – I can’t keep everything, however much I would like to!!! So...don’t DE-clutter, RE-clutter ...FILL YOUR WORLD WITH STORIES!!!!\r\nGifta is short for an Anglo Saxon girls&#39; name : Aelgifu - meaning either ‘gift from the gods’ or ‘elfin gift’, and May is for Mary - (hence the &#39;May&#39; blossom - which I love in Spring - forming the G on the shop banner)  – two names I would rather like to have been called but wasn’t! \r\nKind Regards, Helen Elizabeth\r\n",

Please read additional policies pertaining to the submission of images below and let us know if you have any questions or concerns.. LISTING: https://www.etsy.com/listing/186169097\r\n\r\nDESIGN&#39;S THE LIMIT CUSTOM ARTWORK! Custom made or one of a kind, Design&#39;s the Limit will create a piece of art to your specifications on a piece of glass or mirror to your specified dimensions and ship it to you. We are only limited by the inspiration you provide! Design&#39;s the Limit offers custom made display artwork for your special interest or desire. When you place your order, the non-refundable deposit will allow us to create and submit a design proof and estimate for your approval based on the information and the inspiration you provide. You do not have the rights to reproduce the designs we submit and your deposit is strictly for the time to create your design and estimate the cost of completing and shipping your artwork with Design&#39;s the Limit reserving the rights to the designs which may not be reproduced by others under any circumstances. Design&#39;s the Limit reserves the rights to all of our images and artistic creations as the sole intellectual property of Design&#39;s the Limit, LLC. Reproduction of our images or artwork is strictly prohibited. Every piece of artwork we produce will include a signature (and print number unless created as a one-of-a-kind unique design masterpiece). When specified as a one-of-a-kind design, we will never again reproduce the image we create for you to make your artwork a truly unique artistically inspired design creation. DESIGN&#39;S THE LIMIT&#39;S CUSTOM DISPLAY ARTWORK - \r\nMASTERPIECE LISTING: https://www.etsy.com/listing/176383600\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETCHED, ENGRAVED, AND CARVED?\r\nWhen it comes to personalizing, there is such a wide variety of artists and styles available that we can not cover them all in this explanation. Design&#39;s the Limit employs a combination and variety of techniques including occasional chemical etching, laser engraving for many items, and sandblasted carving depending on the item, the desired effect, and the customer request. Laser engraving offers many advantages, but has it&#39;s own limitations and sandblasted carving gives a desired effect while delaying completion time and increasing costs. Design&#39;s the Limit offers a sandblasted listing for any glassware purchase and for all customer&#39;s who prefer the method of sandblasting: SANDBLASTING: https://www.etsy.com/listing/176565485/sandblast\r\n\r\nCAN I ORDER MY BEER MUG OR COFFEE CUP HANDED? Yes, if you specify that you would like your mug for left handed or right handed orientation Design&#39;s the Limit will fill your order as you have requested at no additional charge. As there is no consensus as to the proper orientation and we often fill orders with engraving on both sides of the mug, we generally complete orders as shown in the main product images. Unless the customer specifies the desired handing at the time of purchase, we reserve the right to complete each order as we see fit depending on the characteristics of the mugs purchased and the design specified. Please let us know if you have any questions or special requests and we would be happy to complete your order to your specifications\r\n\r\nIS THE GLASSWARE DISHWASHER SAFE? They are dishwasher safe, the engraving is permanently engraved, and the designs will not come off. Tatiana and I have a difference of opinion on this matter, as she believes that some dishwashers and some dish detergents will leave small scratches on any glass. She recommends hand-washing with warm water and a soft, non-abrasive sponge. We put a lot of effort into creating our art, so we hand-wash them, but our designs are permanently engraved in the glassware we sell and cannot be removed in the dishwasher. It is the customers responsibility and decision on the method of cleaning the products, but we recommend cleaning thoroughly when you products arrive before use.\r\n\r\nARE THE CUTTING BOARDS FOOD SAFE? The cutting boards and cheese boards are permanently engraved. We like to say the design is already there and just needs to be uncovered. We do not add any product that is not considered food safe to the surface of any of our cutting boards or cheese boards. We recommend cleaning your products thoroughly when they arrive before using and accept no liability for the products we sell. Please read hold-harmless policy below. NOTE: Do not submerge cutting boards or cheese boards in water, surface wash with damp cloth with water only. Do not clean with any substance other than water and do not put in the dishwasher. Submerging wood in water or running through the dishwasher will cause the product to warp or crack and all sales are final. Recommend applying food safe cutting board oil on a semi-regular basis to extend the life of the product.\r\n\r\nARE CRYSTAL GLASSES SAFE? Although generally accepted as safe for use, leaded crystal stemware and decanters pose a significant health risk and proper cleaning and handling instructions should be followed with every use. Design&#39;s the Limit recommends washing thoroughly before and after each use. Design&#39;s the Limit does not recommend storing liquids in the leaded crystal products for longer than needed to entertain and never more than a few hours. Leaded crystal products should be used responsibly by consenting adults only. Design&#39;s the Limit recommends all customers not familiar with leaded crystal products research the subject independently and all customers accept responsibility for the products they purchase and agree to hold Design&#39;s the Limit harmless in accordance with our shop policies. Many of the crystal decanters and crystal stemware we offer are 100% lead free optic crystal and are considered safe for storing liquids in for longer periods of time. Please click &quot;Ask a Question,&quot; if you would like additional information about any other products we sell, but the leaded crystal product listings are identified as such in the product information.\r\n\r\nCAN I ORDER MY PEN OR PENCIL SET HANDED? You can specify handing for a pen or pencil at the time of purchase, but it is not necessary. When you place an order for a pen or pencil with engraving on one side, we engrave your name or information opposite the pen clip. If you specify or purchase engraving on both sides, we engrave your name or information on both sides of the pen or pencil. You can also choose to specify a name on one side of the pen and a job title, company name, or other information on the opposite side of the pen or pencil. Our listing for the metal pen includes three sides which you may choose to have engraved with different information on each side. Design is Limited only by your requests. Design the time to make your personal gift perfectly unique.\r\n\r\nDOES THE TOOTHBOX LID FIT TIGHTLY? Yes, the lid does not fall off if you turn the toothbox upside down and it is perfect for storing teeth and putting under the pillow. To remove the top you have to wiggle or twist is slightly.\r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER QUANTITY DISCOUNTS OR OTHER PROMOTIONS: Design&#39;s the Limit offers an increasing percentage discount based on the quantity purchased of any item in our shop. Design&#39;s the Limit also posts coupon codes and special offers on Twitter and our Facebook page and ask all customers to please like and share before using the coupon codes found there. Design&#39;s the Limit will not retroactively issue refunds for quantity discounts, so make sure to use select the appropriate listing for the quantity you wish to purchase, request a custom listing for any quantity over one dozen, and enter the coupon code at the time of purchase. Please click &quot;Request a Custom Order&quot; and we will create a listing for any quantity you wish to purchase if you include your zip code for shipping. All sales are final and we encourage all of our customers to read the product listings, read our shop policies, and contact us for any questions they may have before making a purchase.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF THE PRODUCT IS DAMAGED IN SHIPPING? Design&#39;s the Limit makes every effort to ensure that your product arrives safely, but occasionally shipping damage does occur. We recommend that all customers open their package as soon as it arrives and contact us if there is any problems with the items you have purchased. Design&#39;s the Limit recommends that all customers select either USPS Priority Mail, USPS Priority Express Mail, or purchase insurance when they place their order. The USPS includes insurance for all USPS Priority Mail and USPS Priority Express Mail shipments, but it is the customers sole responsibility to submit and handle shipping claims directly with the USPS unless additional insurance is included at the time of purchase from either the shipping options drop down menu at checkout or by adding this listing to your shopping cart: INSURANCE LISTING: https://www.etsy.com/listing/187324452/insurance. If you purchase additional insurance at the time of purchase, we will require you to a.) Submit multiple pictures of the product and packaging, b.) Complete, sign, and return a statement about the shipping damage, and c.) Store the damaged item until shipping claims can be resolved.

        "description": "Any man on your gift list will love this bag! It is classic, sophisticated, practical, handmade, and best of all, you can personalize it especially for him with up to 4 initials added for free. \n\nThis spacious bag is constructed of soft, top grain leather in our best-selling Whiskey-Carmel leather. The leather has a semi-aniline finish with a waxy hand to provide a beautiful look and added years of protection against wear and soiling. This toiletry bag is also fully lined in a water resistant nylon, which makes it easy to clean with a damp cloth. All seams are enclosed. \n\nWe use a heavy duty YKK brass zipper closure and leather zipper pull. The wide zipper opening allows easy access to contents. Tabs on both ends make the bag easy to zip open and closed.\n\nEach bag is hand cut and custom embroidered before it is lined and stitched together with strong nylon thread on an industrial sewing machine. Every step is executed carefully so you will have a sturdy, well-constructed bag that will hold up to years of use.\n\nMeasures approximately: 8.5&quot; wide, 3.5&quot; tall, 4&quot; deep. \n\nThis toiletry bag is large enough to hold the essentials a guy might need. \n\nIf you want initials embroidered on the bag, please specify in &quot;comments to seller&quot; when you place your order. We&#39;re happy to make this bag personal! If you would like to order multiples, please select quantity, and let us know in the comments to seller how to initial each dopp kit. \n\nOPTIONAL UPGRADE:\nFor an additional $15, you can include a message up to 30 characters on the inside of the bag, in either block lettering or script lettering. \n\nBecause this is a hand-crafted product, every bag will be slightly different in terms of its color and texture, but comes with a guarantee of solid, consistent construction. Don&#39;t be fooled by other sellers who embroider commercially-made bags and then label them hand-made. Here at Felix Street Studio, we source our leather hides locally, cut all of our own leather, and produce all of our products from scratch. You can be sure that if you purchase from Felix Street, you are getting a quality product made from American materials by one of our talented in-house artisans. \n\nHappy with the design, but wish it was a little bigger? A larger size is also available! Please see this listing: https://www.etsy.com/listing/167268622/personalized-gift-for-man-larger-leather",

Our goal is to make every transaction a fabulous experience, from initial order, to packaging, to your pleasure in using my handcrafted items.  Please contact me if you have any questions at all.  \r\n\r\nWe are frequently approached about offering discounts, or selling  to retailers at wholesale prices.  Our Etsy prices reflect a fair compensation for our time, talent, and materials. We do not inflate my prices so that we can offer &quot;discounts&quot;.  Etsy provides a venue where we don&#39;t have to pay for additional middle-woman or distribution costs, and we prefer to pass that value on to our one-on-one customers.  So, please know that you are getting our very best pricing and although we are flattered by the requests, we do not offer wholesale pricing to re-sellers. ",

Shipping commitments are serious business here, and we keep our promises.  Please double-check the ship-to address before you order.  Obviously,we cannot honor delivery commitments if your provide the wrong address.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that handcrafted personalized goods are made after they are ordered. We are proud of our turn around times and we are fast.  But if you need your order by &quot;Friday&quot; please let us know so we can upgrade your order to RUSH/Priority status and charge you accordingly.\r\n\r\nAfter shipping thousands of packages, we have great confidence in the United States Postal Service.  However, sometimes a package is marked as delivered but does not make it into the buyer&#39;s possession - particularly when delivered to apartments.  When the US postal service tells us they have delivered the package to a correctly addressed location, we must assume theft.  Therefore, we do not issue refunds or replacements on orders identified by USPS as delivered.  \r\n\r\nInternational Customers:\r\n\r\nUSPS First class INTERNATIONAL mail is not insured through the United States Postal Service (USPS). Items shipped via First Class International Mail will not be insured if your item is lost in the mail. It cannot be traced or tracked.  Under these conditions we cannot offer refund or replacement.  By purchasing the items, you accept these terms. Estimated Delivery Time averages 15 business days from date shipped.\r\n\r\nWe will gladly ship to most countries.  However, we cannot  track your shipment or guarantee delivery.  Unfortunately, international packages do sometimes go astray once they leave the U.S.  \r\n\r\nImport duties, taxes, and charges are not included in the item price or shipping cost. These charges are the buyer&#39;s responsibility. Please check with your country&#39;s customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to buying. \r\n\r\nWe will gladly ship to most countries.

In this rare event, your order will be promptly replaced.  Please read through my feedback to review the thousands of positive experiences with previous customers who left ratings.",

These fees and taxes and any additional charges for customs clearance are levied once a shipment reaches your country, and must be borne by the recipient. I have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. Please be aware that when customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond my original delivery estimates.

For instance Office Depot, etc all can print for $0.70 per copy and can even cut it for you!  Or you can send the file to a printer and they will print on cut on their professional machines.   \r\n\r\nIf you are printing labels instead of tags I do not suggest purchasing pre-cut (Avery for instance) labels and attempting to line up the file to their layout.  It is definitely easiest to print the file on a full sheet and cut to your dimensions!\r\n\r\nHope they are a hit!\r\nRachel",

            "policy_shipping": "Standard orders in the US ship in 3 business days and are typically 3-5 business days once shipped (or 6-8 business days to your door from the time of placing your order.) \r\n\r\nI also offer 3 expedited services you can choose at check out. \r\n\r\n1)  PRIORITY SHIPPING $4.50 upgrade-  Typically 5-6 business days to your door.\r\n2)  RUSH $12.00 upgrade - Ships next business day PRIORITY  Typically 3-4 business days to your door from placing order.  Insurance included.\r\n3)  EXPRESS $26.45 upgrade - Next day (or same day if possible) turnaround and EXPRESS shipping (typically 1-2 day service).  1-3 days to your door from placing order.  Insurance Included.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind RUSH EXPRESS is the only shipping option guaranteed by USPS!  You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed.\r\n\r\nUSPS and I have a love/hate relationship.  I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time.  Ug.  Which takes me to my next point--\r\nUSPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS.  Sad but true.  Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents.  For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option.  Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well.  This bumps you to the front of every line.\r\n\r\nUSPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;.  Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order!\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\n\r\nStandard Shipping (6-8 business days to your door)\r\nRUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door)\r\nEXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back.\r\n\r\nI have had very few issues with the USPS however it does happen.  Typically 5 out of every 100.  I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\nInternational shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.)  USPS does not guarantee these shipping times and from time-to-time there are significant delays in Customs.  USPS does offer guaranteed services (which are super expensive but again, guaranteed.)  Please message me directly if you are interested in International guaranteed USPS delivery. \r\n\r\n7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) \t$30.50 USD\r\n9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) \t$25.50 USDD\r\n4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping \t$45.75 USD\r\n\r\n***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries.  Because sellers are unable to predict what fees, if any, certain countries will apply, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes.  In my experience I have only seen this through Royal Mail.  Just a heads up!",

Please note a &quot;PROOF REQUEST&quot; on your order at check out if interested!  Proofs must be approved within 14 days or will be shipped as-is.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that some designs have all lowercase font (disregarding proper noun capitalization) per their design -- although this is intended and recommended it can be changed if stated in a separate sentence as a &quot;request for proper noun capitalization&quot;",

        "description": "This listing is for a set of two 14 ounce double old fashioned scotch whiskey rock glasses that can be personalized via sandblasting to your taste. I can put a name, a short piece of text, an initial or a monogram on these glasses using the font shown above. Each glass can be different as well. Just let me know in the &quot;notes to seller&quot; what you want if you order.\n\nI can also in some cases sandblast your design onto these as long as it is simple enough to cut as a sandblast stencil. Use the &quot;ask a question&quot; button and attach the image you want and I&#39;ll let you know if I can sandblast it or not.\n\nIf you want more than 4 glasses, please use the ask a question button with both the number of glasses you want and your zip code so I can give you a quote. Shipping on etsy&#39;s calculator is way off on this item for more than 4 glasses.\n\nPlease do note that 20 or more glasses have to be ordered at least 5 weeks ahead of the date you need them so I have time to make them AND the post office can deliver them to you.\n\nThe process I use is sandblasting, not paint or vinyl stickers...so these glasses are top-rack dishwasher safe as well as being permanent. The images shown are digitally generated and show approximately what text would look like on the glasses. These glasses are also made by hand, not by computerized laser engraving so please be aware there may be slight differences between each glass.\n\nThe last image show the glasses I obtain from the local restaurant supply store. They are unbranded generic double old fashioned glasses. Name brand glasses (i.e. Libby or Anchor Hocking) I can special order, but they are expensive and I will pass the costs along.\n\nUp to six glasses ships via USPS Priority mail to any US address, including APO/FPO, Alaska and Hawaii.",

Please contact me with your zip code for an overnight or Priority shipping quote.\r\n\r\nThis is a small shop and each piece of glass has its stencil cut and sandblasted one by one, I do not contract work out to China nor do I do laser engraving, so turnaround time depends on my workload (and the weather since I can&#39;t sandblast during lightning storms).\r\n\r\n****************\r\nOnce payment is received and your order is complete, it will be shipped via either USPS Parcel Post or Priority Mail with a tracking number. \r\n\r\nI will only ship to US addresses including APO/FPO, Alaska, Guam and Hawaii.\r\n\r\nSmaller items ship via Priority and usually will arrive within a week after mailing.  \r\n\r\nIn regards to shipping quotes, I know it seems expensive but those are the numbers USPS gives me. I am shipping glass, not plastic.\r\n\r\n\r\n***COMBINING ORDERS***\r\nI can do combined shipping quotes for large numbers of items. Please send me a custom order request with everything you want as well as your zip code so I can weigh it and get a quote from USPS. Please request this BEFORE you order, not after. If you order multiple items using separate accounts for each order, your items will be shipped separately according to each account&#39;s order.\r\n***COMBINING ORDERS***\r\n\r\nI can ship to alternate addresses if its a gift, however I will not pack the glass into gift boxes or wrap them since it will make the cost of shipping prohibitive. I can add a gift note to the package if you wish though.\r\n\r\nLarge sets such as pitchers ship Parcel Post due to their weight. Parcel Post is slow since USPS considers it low priority and only moves packages based upon space available in their trucks. Continental US addresses, assume it will likely arrive within two weeks. Hawaii, Alaska and APO/FPO expect it to be much longer.\r\n\r\nFor packages that are shipped to an OLD mailing address provided, I will not liable for packages sent to the wrong address, therefore can not re-send another.  Please make sure your both your address on Paypal and Etsy match and is accurate, up to date and complete. If you use the wrong address in either Etsy or Paypal, please send me a convo ASAP with the correct address.\r\n\r\n***Shipping to Hawaii and Guam***\r\n\r\nI will ship to Hawaii and Guam, but do note that Parcel Post for larger items is extremely slow on the order of four-five weeks since packages are put onto a boat in California for their trip west. If you want something faster, upgrades to air services (i.e. Priority or Express) can be done if you are willing to pay for it. Smaller items such as beer mugs, pint glasses and whiskey glasses are shipped via Priority and will make it to the islands fairly quickly since they go via air plane instead of boat.",
            "policy_refunds": "Due to the customized nature of my work, all sales are final.\r\n\r\nIf glass arrives in the mail broken, contact me imminently with a photograph of the broken object and I will see what I can do. Usually I will replace broken glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
            "policy_additional": "==========================\r\n***DISCOUNTS***\r\n\r\nI do not give military discounts. My glassware is already priced cheaper than it would cost at the base exchange gift shop to have glass custom etched and I&#39;m already effectively working at below minimum wage rates with the prices I set.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nStencils for sandblasting are cut partially by hand, so each piece is slightly unique and may not be 100% identical from glass to glass. \r\n\r\nIf you need absolute perfection, please check with a shop that does computerized laser engraving.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nREVIEWS/FEEDBACK SPAM: \r\n\r\nEtsy has recently replaced its existing Feedback system with a ‘Review’ option based on a star rating. Buyers have a certain timeframe in which they are able to leave a review, and in conjunction with this function the Etsy system will send out “reminders” if a review has not been left. \r\n\r\nNavyBratGlass considers reminders of this nature to be intrusive and would like to assure all buyers that any “review reminder” emails or messages that they may receive from Etsy DO NOT originate from our shop. We hate being nagged just as much as you do! However, please accept our sincere thanks for any positive reviews that you may choose to submit; we are sorry that Etsy no longer affords sellers the opportunity to do so via the feedback system.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n***RUSH ORDERS***\r\n\r\nContact me WITH YOUR ZIP CODE if you need something sooner than 2-3 weeks. Depending on my work schedule, I may be able to do rush orders.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n***CUSTOMIZATION***\r\n\r\nIf you want something customized, please contact me before purchasing an item to ensure the text you want will fit on the back if you are not sure. For the most part, names, dates, rates/ranks will fit without a problem - but on certain pieces, fitting long text is a bit tricky.\r\n\r\nI am sandblasting the glass, not laser etching, so there is a limit to how much text can be placed on much of the glass. Due to the nature of the work, all customizations will be done after the listing is purchased and paid for.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n***CUSTOM ART***\r\n\r\nIf you have art you wish to consider having sandblasted onto something, the artwork will need to be black & white and a minimum of 500x500 pixels. I will not custom draw artwork from scratch. Please send a convo with the art you are considering attached so I can look at it to see if it can be sandblasted before you order.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n***OTHER INFO***\r\n\r\nSandblasting is done by hand and as a result, no two items will be identical.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of disclosure to buyers, glassware may have flaws from the manufacturer. Examples would be swirls, ripples and air bubbles. However, we do as a general rule try to pick glass pieces to etch that is as clean as possible.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n***DONATIONS***\r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, I receive numerous requests for donations of my work to various groups. My apologies, I&#39;d love to help everyone, but I cannot afford to ship glass at my cost all over the world. Any donations I do are to certain local groups and any convos asking for donations will be ignored. And to give folks new to Etsy a heads up so you don&#39;t get in trouble, using the convo system for soliciting donations is against Etsy&#39;s Terms of Use and there are shops on here who will report donation requests as spam.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n***WHOLESALE***\r\n\r\nI do not do wholesale orders. Sorry.",

So PLEASE respond to messages. Unless otherwise discussed. \n\n\nI no longer offer rushed orders. Orders Generally take a 1.5 - 2 weeks for creation and delivery once you place your order. They may take longer or shorter depending on delivery location and time it takes to get the proof OK&#39;ed. I will send a proof within 1-5 days of order. If you need the labels quickly, please consider the digital file (ask for details), or ask me to skip the proof process. (Be sure to tell me exactly what you want on the labels) I can also offer Express shipping for an additional charge.

        "description": "Hip Flask in Art Deco style features a costumed lady in full deco glam, accompanied by a striking white peacock. Golden tree branches with soft white blossoms are draped behind her. From her brilliant blue earrings and headband to her bright pink nails to her red ballet shoes, she is a delight! Adapted from a design by French costume designer George Barbier, who worked with Erte in the 1920&#39;s. This little cutie is the perfect companion when you reach for your stylish flask on a chilly night! The image is permanently embedded into the surface of the flask using a high-tech process that heats the material to over 400 degrees! So this means no glue, no sealant, no paper or fabric &quot;wrap&quot; on this flask - the image is smooth and washable! This unique product is unlike most others you will see elsewhere, and the design makes it even more special.\r\n\r\nI have coordinating accessories so you can mix and match to create your own Gift Set!\r\nPhone Case: http://etsy.me/OJXtSY\r\nPill Box: http://etsy.me/Oz0Ygr\r\n\r\nBrowse all my flask designs here: http://etsy.me/1qZiRL5\r\n\r\n ● D E T A I L S ●\r\nSleek stainless steel flask feels great in your hand. Each vintage style flask measures approximately 4&quot; tall, 3.5&quot; wide, and 1&quot; thick. 6 oz of your favorite beverage will be conveniently at the ready when you need a little nip! Screw off cap seals tightly. Your flask comes attractively packaged in a black organza bag so it is ready for gift-giving, and a filling funnel is included. Hip flasks make a great wedding gift, bridesmaid or groomsmen&#39;s gift, Christmas gift for both men and women, or just a little something special for you!\r\n\r\nS H I P P I N G\r\nCurrent processing time is 4-5 business days.

Each barrel head has been sanded and glued. The initial or name is hand made and will be perfect on arrival. We can pretty much do any design, just let us know what you&#39;d like. We have tinkered with a few of these and found a fine point black sharpie marker works the best. Then just spray it with a semi gloss polyurethane and you&#39;re finished. You can then turn this into a work of art for your wall, a lazy Susan, a serving tray, a table top, etc. the options are endless. Thanks for looking- Kevin",
